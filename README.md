# LINE-MOD-Pipeline for object detection and pose estimation

The pipeline uses the OpenCV LINE-MOD Detector to estimate the pose of a known Object. 
Necessary Pre and Postprocessing tools are included:
* Generation of Templates from CAD-Models with OpenGL
* Color and depth checks to validate a match
* ICP algorithm from OpenCV for pose refinement

Included libraries for testing are:
* Kinect V2 tool to extract depth and rgb images
* Implementation of the LINE-MOD Benchmark for validation

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

For compilation the following libraries must be included and linked
* [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) - Creates a window for OpenGL
* [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) - OpenGL Extension Library
* [OPENCV](https://opencv.org/) - Computer vision library
* [GLM](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html) - Graphics math library
* [libfreenect2](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect2) - Kinect V2 driver (only if Kinect is used)

### Installing

OpenCV needs to be built with:
- additional contrib libraries for LINE-MOD and ICP
- atleast SSE 3 support
- OpenMP
